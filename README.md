# Adaptive Coding Tutor

The **Adaptive Coding Tutor** is an AI-powered platform designed to help users improve their coding skills through interactive, challenge-based learning. Users can engage with a Large Language Model (LLM) to request coding challenges, solve them in a code editor, and receive feedback in real time.

## Features

- **Coding Challenges**: Users can request coding challenges directly from the website.
- **Interactive Code Editor**: Users solve challenges in a built-in code editor and submit their solutions.
- **Automated Code Evaluation**: The LLM assesses the submitted code and provides feedback:
  - **Correct**: If the solution is correct, the user is notified of their success.
  - **Incorrect**: If the solution is incorrect, the user can either:
    - **Try Again**: Resubmit a revised solution.
    - **Step-by-Step Solution**: Request a step-by-step explanation to learn the correct approach.
- **User Interface**: The platform includes a chat interface with user responses in blue and bot responses in gray.
